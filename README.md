Read the data from excel using pandas and data contains different attributes in columns.</br>
Spilt the 90% of the data into training and remaining for testing.<br/>
First initialised the model with some layer and initialised its weights.</br>
Then using forward propagation to find the predicted output and then comparing with the training data to find the errors.<br/>
Then using backpropagation to update the weights using error from before and training the model.</br>
After updating the weights we will predict the output from the test data.<br/>
